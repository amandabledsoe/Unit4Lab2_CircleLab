This my solution for Unit 4: Lab 2 "Circle Lab" in the 2022 C# .NET After-Hours Boot Camp at Grand Circus.

# CIRCLE OBJECTS
### Objectives: 
Objects, Methods, Member Variables

### Task: 
Calculate a circle’s circumference and area.

### What will the application do?
- The application prompts the user to enter a radius; the user may enter a decimal number.
- The application displays an error if the user enters invalid data and asks the user again for a radius.
- When the user enters valid data, the application calculates the area and circumference of the circle and rounds to the nearest 2 decimal places and prints out both.
- The application asks the user whether they want to do another.
- The application displays a “goodbye” message that also indicates the number of circles the user built when the user chooses not to continue.

### Build Specifications:
- Create a class named Circle to store the data about this circle. This class should contain these constructors and methods:
1. public Circle(double radius)
2. public double CalculateCircumference()
3. public string CalculateFormattedCircumference()
4. public double CalculateArea()
5. public string CalculateFormattedArea()
6. private string FormatNumber(double x)
- Define a member called radius. This member should be private. 
- Define a property to get access to the class member: Radius 
- For the value of pi, use the PI constant of the System.Math class.
- In the Main method, get the user input, create a Circle object, and display the circumference and area.

### Hints:
- Don’t mess up the formulas for circumference or area of a circle!

### Extra Challenges:
- Create a class named Validator and use its static methods to validate the data in this application.

Console Preview:
```
Welcome to the Circle Tester
Enter radius: 3
Circumference: 18.85
Area:      	28.27
Continue? (y/n): n
Goodbye. You created 2 Circle object(s).
```
